## If I have more time..
1- I would create API documentaion using technologies like swagger  

2- I would create a global unified response handler module to be used in all endpoints rather than setting rsponse status code and returning response without setting custom response messages

3- I would return custom response and error messages 

4- I would create a seperate test database (or in-memory database for test) other than the actual database

5- I would create docker file for this app

6- I would deploy the app
